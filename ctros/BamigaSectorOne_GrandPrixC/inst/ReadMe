Short:    AGA/HD fix for Bamiga Sector One "GP-Circuit" Cracktro
Author:   S.Pucino@gmx.de (Max Headroom/TEX)
Uploader: S.Pucino@gmx.de (Max Headroom/TEX)
Version:  1.1
Type:     demo/patch
Requires: WHDLoad v14.x+

This patch applies to Grand Prix Circuit Crack-Intro, © 198x Bamiga Sector One & Cybertech

And another old-school masterpiece was fixed ;)
This cracktro fascinated my friend because of it's childish song. It sounds
like a circus song and could have been done by a clown ;)
I reworked the source a bit.  It's easier to maintain now.  Some "fixed"
addresses are replaced by variables.
Enjoy the intro and look out for more patches ;-)

REQUIREMENTS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - WHD-Load V14+
 - The executable itself ! Download it under...
   http://ftp.amigascne.org/pub/groups/b/bamiga_sector_one/bs1-crackgrandprixcircuit
 - Intro req. 0.5 MB ChipMem
 - Barfly or ASM-One for compilation. I prefer ASM-One for smaller code ^_^

FEATURES:
~~~~~~~~~
 - Replaced empty DBRA-loop by VHPOSR-waiter (SoundTracker-bug)
 - Removed access fault: BYTE-Write to $BFD100

HISTORY:
~~~~~~~~
 1.1 (2024-08-12) by Wepl
 - made working, due typo this never worked before, looks like Max put on old Slave
   into the archive because it also did not match some info from the ReadMe
 - removed OSEmu usage
 - added keyboard quit
 - removed Snoop issues
 - tested on 68060/50
 - new icons created by Irek Kloska, thanks!
 - source: https://github.com/wepl/winstalls/tree/master/ctros/BamigaSectorOne_GrandPrixC

CAVEATS:
~~~~~~~~
 - Tested ONLY on my A1230/50 MHz (2MB Chip, 16MB Fast).
   Sorry, no more hardware at home.  ^_^
 - I haven't done an icon for it. A little bit too lazy now.
   Enjoy a standard icon ^,-
 - I'm a BEGINNER ! Please don't expect something like an assembler-crack
   who gives you a PPC-native slave ;)

Still in work...
