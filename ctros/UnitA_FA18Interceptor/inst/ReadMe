Author:   S.Pucino@gmx.de (Max Headroom/TEX)
Uploader: S.Pucino@gmx.de (Max Headroom/TEX)
Version:  1.0
Type:     demo/intro
Requires: WHD-Load v14.x+

This patch applies to F/A 18 Interceptor Crack-Intro, © 02/06/1988 by Unit-A

And another intro from my first intro-collection ;)
It was a cracktro to the Interceptor flight-simulator.  A real cool game.
The intro had this cool bass and impressed me with the UA-animation.

REQUIREMENTS:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - WHD-Load V14+
 - Intro req. 0.5 MB ChipMem
 - Barfly or ASM-One for compilation. I prefer ASM-One for smaller code ^_^

FEATURES:
~~~~~~~~~
 - File-loader via OSEmu (included)
 - Replaced empty DBRA-Loop in SoundTracker-player
 - Removed useless "UNIT" check at $80
 - Nice OS3.5 Icon included.
 - Complete and fully commented source-code included !

CAVEATS:
~~~~~~~~
 - Tested ONLY on my A1230/50 MHz (2MB Chip, 16MB Fast).
   Sorry, no more hardware at home.  ^_^
 - I'm a BEGINNER ! Please don't expect something like an assembler-crack
   who gives you a PPC-native slave ;)

Still in work...
