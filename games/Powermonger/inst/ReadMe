	That install applies to "Powermonger" © 1990 Bullfrog.

	That install requires WHDLoad and DIC to be in the path. Both
	can be found in the whdload package.

	You need 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
	You can quit the game by pressing ESC or F10 (key can be changed with
	Tooltype "QuitKey=")

	Manual protection has been removed. One Access Fault fixed. Savegame
	redirected to harddisk. Keyboard routine fixed.

	To extract your savegames from a floppy :
		create a disk image using DIC from your savegame disk
		enter the directory where "Disk.1" is stored, and
		execute "sgsaver", all valid savegames are extracted,
		move them now to the Powermonger save directory ...

	Thanx to Peter Schreck and Harley Kingston for media support.
