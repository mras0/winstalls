 This install applies to "Tech" © 1989 Gainstar/The Omega Team.

 This install requires WHDLoad and RawDIC to be in the path. Both can be found
 in the WHDLoad package.
 To install from a different drive than DF0: select installation mode Expert.

 The installed program requires 0.5 MB ChipMem and 0.5 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires a installed A500 Kickstart 1.3 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick34005.A500". The image can be extracted from a A500 with
 tools like 'GrabKick' or similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 a appropriate requester.
 Additionally the file "kick34005.A500.RTB" must be installed in the same
 directory as the kickstart image. It can be found in the archive 
 "util/boot/skick343.lha" on aminet.

 If you have problems with this installation please try and get a newer
 version of this package from the WHDLoad WWW-Page. If that doesn't help try
 some Tooltypes like NOCACHE, NOAUTOVEC, NOVBRMOVE, NOMMU, PAL or NTSC. If
 that also fails, please inform the author via the Bug-Report-Form which
 can be accessed on the WHDLoad WWW-Page.

 version 1.0 (31.10.01) done by Wepl:
 - initial release
 - diskformat uses no checksums, so there might be problems with weak disks...
 - button wait for titel picture inserted
 - all files can be compressed using ProPack/FImp
 I like that game, nice design, nice graphics and great synthesizer sound :)

 version 1.1 (27.08.24) done by Wepl:
 - Slave now uses new style kickemu which avoids one OS switch
 - new imager which has builtin CRCs for all tracks (issue #6450)
 - new install script
 - files are placed in 'data' sub directory now
 - source available: https://github.com/wepl/winstalls
 
 Many thanks to Sören and Christoph Gleisberg for providing an original image.
