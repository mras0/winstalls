KILLBRAGANT

England
September 21

Dear Diary,

That creepy portrait in the castle's front hallway should have
tipped me off right away.  I mean, I'm not used to running
into people who look exactly like me - especially people
who've been dead over 100 years.  So my First Encounter
with Lady Emelda of Killbragant was definitely of the Weird
Kind.

Maybe I shouldn't have been so surprised.  According to
the papers from the attorneys (Dybbuk, Doppelganger,
Wraith, and Eldritch), the resemblance isn't just coinci-
dence: it turns out Lady Emelda was also my Great-Great
Grandmama Emelda.  It also turns out that, with the demise
of my evil Uncle Elmo, I now own this place - lock, stock,
and dungeon.

Apart from the striking family resemblance, I've got to
admire Emelda's taste in clothes: she sure gets a lot of
mileage out of that little black number she's barely wearing
in her portrait.  Too bad I can't say the same for this
rockpile's decor: pretty dusty and musty, but nothing that
can't be fixed with some neon lighting, a couple of
Naugahyde couches, and a few movie posters alongside
those strange paintings with the shifty eyeballs.

I'd like to turn this place into sort of a macabre bed-and-
breakfast - the kind of place you visit if your idea of "bed"
includes marble slabs, and "breakfast" is blood sausage
and Killer Tomatoes.  After all, there's a hedge maze in the
garden, a kitchen that's better equipped than Dr. Franken-
stein's lab, enough bedrooms upstairs to hold all of Them,
and some great views of the northern English moors from
the roof - so Killbragant should be a wicked place to enter-
tain a few tourists when I get it cleaned up.

October 9

My redecorating project is coming along: we may even get
the place open for the Halloween season.  But these days
life is getting stranger than "The head with two things"...
Uh, I mean "The thing with two heads!"

This afternoon, while crawling through a heap of legal
papers big enough to hide Rodan, I found an old clipping
from the local paper that may explain why the place has
been deserted since the Bloody Mary days.  They ran it as a
Halloween gag, but it reads more like a late-night horror
movie.

It seems that Great-Great Grandmama Emelda was married
to this kinda boring dude.  Sir Eric, who spent a lot of time
on the road managing the family affairs in India.  He left
time with nobody but a few bats to keep her company -
until this guy Lord Beremnd showed up one day, and
started a little family affair of his own.

Beremond was some sort of evil wizard who had a readl way
with women.  He sure had a way with Grandmama, because
she invited the creep to move in with her.  They wrere a real
fun couple: when they weren't upstairs doing nasty things
to each other, they were downstairs doing nasty things to
the terrorized locals ... or down in the catacombs conjuring
even more nasty things from the Realms Beyond.

Apparently, Beremond thought he
was Evil Incarnate, and everyone
else was inclined to agree, mainly
because he made the entire
county worship him (kinda like
some Hollywood producers I've
known) on pain of violent death.
Before long, the entire neighbor-
hood looked like a permanent
Night of the Living Dead.


Page 3 follows:

So, anyway, Beremond and Emelda were the original grue-
some twosome ... until the day Beremond was hit by a stray
arrow during a hunting trip, which punched his one-way
ticket to Goonland.  Emelda took over the operation, with
the help of some unearthly beasties, a handful of ghoulish
Handmaidens, and an army of Palace Guards From Hell.

Of course, the next time Sir Elric checked in, he wasn't
exactly thrilled.  The crops were dead, the tenant farmers
had been massacred, a gang of goblins was gyrating in his
foyer, and his wife had obviously been getting beauty tips
from the Bride of Frankenstein.  Not that he was around
long enough to gripe about it: shortly after he got home,
Emelda seduced him, suckered him into a compromising
position, and ran him through with the old family sword.

End of problem - except for Elric's little revenge, who was
born nine months later and grew up to be my great grandpa.
Understandably, the kid left home as soon as he was old
enough to be allowed ouside alone after dark.

Emelda died many years later, (much to her own surprise:
she was sure that Satan was going to make her immortal,
which is a line that anyone who's done time in Hollywood
would never fall for).  Instead, she had to settle for resurrec-
tion sometime in the far-off future (a sort of diabolical
don't-call-us-we'll-call-you).  The directions for starting (and
stopping) her resurrection are supposed to be somewhere
here in the castle - part of "The Scroll of Spiritual Mastery"
hidden in an old chest.  The chest takes six keys to unlock.
She gave the keys to her loyal flunkies, and told them that if
they held onto them, they could come back with her the
second time around - and this time, they'd rule the world.

The neighbors believe that her gang of ghosts and ghouls
still haunt this place.  In fact, the vicar and some of the town
honchos took me to tea this afternoon - nice folks, though
a little eccentric - and were emphatic that the place will
need "a thorough cleaning out" before it's safe to inhabit.

I don't think they mean mopping down the staircase with
Mr. Clean.


Page 4 follows:

Do I believe them?  I'm not sure - the story's weird, but I'm
in show business, and I've heard weirder.  I'm definitely
putting it in the castle's tourist brochure, though: it's bound
to attract the right kind of people.  And as far as my own
safety is concerned, it seems stupid to rent a hotel room in
town when I've got my own castle to stay in.

I'd write more, but it's getting dark out, and there's a lot to
get done around here.  Also, I think I hear someone walking
around downstairs, so I'm gonna go check it out.  Later -

Halloween Eve

That little fable about
Grandmama Emelda
was a cute story -
but not that cute.
When I decided to open the place up for "Elvira's Horror
Weekends," I hoped the place would be full from basement
to battlements by Halloween.  It is - but this isn't quite the
kind of company I had in mind.

For one thing, these guests aren't paying.

For another, they're not even alive.

None of this, of course, has stopped them from taking over
the place, like they owned it or something.

It started out a few weeks back, when a few odd monks
started wandering around downstairs in the middle of the
night.  I enjoy meeting men of the cloth, and figured I'd be
friendly with them, until I realized that there was nothing
under the cloth.  I'm talking incorporeal.  (And I don't know
what incorporeal means!)

The monks turned out to be the advance men for a growing
army of creepy critters - gremlins who like to play hide-
and-seek in the hedge maze, soldiers guarding the bed-
rooms, skeletons doing Grateful Dead impersonations in the
catacombs downstairs - and busloads of more beasties
arriving every day.


Page 5 follows:

Worst of all (at least of all the ones I know about) is the
incorporeal corporal who's manning th gatehouse out front
24 hours a day ... sort of Gomer Pyle meets the Marquis de
Sade.  Because of him, I can't get out of here - and if I
could, I wouldn't get back in alive.  In fact, with all the traffic
in the hallways.  I'm sort of stuck in the kitchen with nothing
but a few cookbooks to keep me company.

It's clear to me now that this little creature convention has
been called in my honor.  Seems that in the course of the
restoration, I've also revived Emelda's memory - along
with several hundred of her closest freinds.  The sordid little
legend of Emelda the Evil is becoming more real every day.
And if things continue, I may soon get to meet her face-to-
fangs - not my idea of a warm family reunion.

I've got to shake down my houseguests until I find those six
keys, get my hands on Emelda's chest, and find out how to
put a stop to Grandmama's imminent return.

But I may not have to do it all alone.  Help should be arriv-
ing any minute.  The last time I ventured out of Killbragant, I
picked up a copy of "Broomsticks Weekly" and got in touch
with one of the freelance ghostbusters who advertise in the
back pages.  They agreed to come over today and give me an
estimate.  If they're smart enough to let themselves into the
castle - and avoid the Freddy Krueger clone at the
gatehouse - we have a slim chance of stopping Emelda's
return, and reclaiming Killbragant (and maybe the whole world)
for the living.

I just might be in business after all.


Page 6 follows:

WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE

Nice-looking castle, isn't it?  Almost sorta sweet, with the
little gate out front, and the flowers on the front lawn.
You'd hardly guess that I'm going to have to go on the
warpath against about 999 Goons from the Seventh Dimen-
sion to reclaim what's mine in the first place - the right to
a decent night's sleep in my own house.

Anyway, I'm glad that somebody was interested enough to
answer my ad and help me out.  I was kinda hoping for
someone a little taller, maybe with armor and a sword.
Instead, I get a computer freak who keeps trying to tell me
that swords and spells are no match for a trusty two-button
mouse.

I'll believe that when I see it.  In the meantime, let me show
you around the place, and tell you how things work.


Page 7 follows:

The Main Screen

Everything that happens at Killbragant happens on the Main
Screen, which consists of the following:

   Inventories
   Main Window
   Command Menu
   Directional Arrows
   Exit Commands
   Stats Bard
   Lower Window

What do you mean, "I don't get it!??"  The Adventurers'
Union said that you were an experienced castle-cleaner,
a real fantasy-games stud.  And now you want me to explain
a simple computer interface.  This does wonders for my
confidence.

Oh, all right.  Here's how it works:

Main Window

This is where all the action occurs:  exploration, mystery,
plunder, carnage, and a little cooking on the side.

The Main Window represents your point of view.  Although
most movements is accomplished by clicking on the direc-
tional arrows at the left of the screen, there are special
instances when clicking directly on objects in the Main
Window will get you closer to your goal.

Doors

As you explore the castle and its surroundings, you'll come
across many closed doors.  Click on a door to open it.  But
be wary!  You never know who or what might be lurking
behind the doors in this place.


Page 8 follows:

Objects, Etc.

You'll also discover lots of important objects, weapons,
notes, portraits, etc. as you walk around the castle.  By
clicking on the object in the Main Window, you'll get the
name of the object.  To get a description of the object, click
on the object and then click on EXAMINE in the right-hand
Command Menu.

The Red "R"

Occasionally, you'll get an "up-close & personal" look at
some item when you click on an object or location on the
screen.  These can be deliciously gruesome - bodies with
their throats torn out, that sort of thing.

There might be objects you want in these close-ups.  Pick
them up as explained (see Collecting Things just below).
You'll also see a large red "R" in the lower right hand corner
of the Main Window.  Click on the red "R" to return to a
regular perspective view.

Collecting Things

if an object looks interesting or important, pick it up.  Sim-
ply click & hold on the object, then drag the cursor to the
inventory icon at the upper left of the screen.  Release the
mouse button, and the object will disappear from the screen
and appear in your inventory.

For more on Inventories and Handling Objects & Weapons,
read on.


Page 9 follows:

Lower Window

The Lower Window does several things.  Depending on your
situation, it may:

o   Display the items in your personal inventory or
    weapons inventory.
o   Show which items in a room are removable.
o   Give specific information on individual items and
    entities you encounter in the game.
o   Serve as a dialog box.

Inventories

The three inventory commands in the upper left corner give
you control over all movable objects in the game.  (To
manipulate the objects, see Handling Objects & Weapons
on page 11.)

ROOM

When you click this command once with the left mouse
button, all movable objects in the room that you have
clicked on (in the Main Window) appear in the Lower Window.

o   If there are many objects available, red scroll arrows
    appear at the right side of the Lower Window.  Click on
    the arrows to scroll through all of the movable objects
    in the room.
o   Double-click on any objects to get a description of that
    object.  Click on the Lower Window one more time to
    clear the description and return to the Inventory Window.


Page 10 follows:

INV

Click on this command with the left mouse button to view
all the items you are carrying.  Your personal inventory
changes instantly as you pick up or drop items.  If you're
hauling a lot of stuff, red scroll arrows appear at the right
of the Lower Window.  To scroll through the inventory, click
on the arrows.

   Note: Any weapon you pick up will appear in
   your personal inventory.  But hand-to-hand
   combat weapons will also appear in your Weapons
   Inventory.

How Much Stuff Can I Carry?

You can carry an amazing amount of stuff, so don't be shy.
help yourself to anything in the castle that isn't staked
down.  On the other hand, greed does have its price ... a
price paid in strength.  If you're an incurable collector, you'd
better hope you don't run into one of Emelda's extra-power-
ful goons.

Dropping Objects

If you find yourself overburdened with goodies, you can
drop some.  Simply click on the item in your inventory and
drag the cursor onto the Main Window.  Release the mouse
button and the item will be dropped into the room where
you're currently standing.

You may place your hand onto INVENTORY and drag it to
ROOM and clear out your entire inventory.

   Note: It might be a good idea to make a note of
   where you leave items.  They will stay where you
   drop them, and you can always come back and pick
   them up later.

WEAPONS

This works just like the personal inventory (see INV above),
but it only shows the hand-to-hand combat weapons you're
carrying: Swords, daggers, etc.  Remember, these
weapons also appear in your personal inventory.


Page 11 follows:

Handling Objects & Weapons

This is not rocket science - in fact, it's probably even less
complicated than most things.  Bust just to make sure, I'll
explain it.  The directions below apply to weapons and
anything else you may find.

To Examine an Object

There are two ways to do it:

1    Click on the object on the Main Screen.  Click EXAMINE
     on the Command Menu.

2    Double-click on the object in the Main Window.

Either way, a description appears in the Lower Window.

To Pick Up an Object

Put the arrow cursor on the object, and hold down the left
mouse button.  The arrow turns into a hand.  Drag the hand
to one of the inventory commands - INV or WEAPONS to
pick up objects.  ROOM to drop objects.

To Use an Object

Click on the object you want to use.  The item can be in
either the Main Window or the Lower Window.  Move to the
Command Menu, and click USE.  This is important for
selecting and using weapons.  The weapon, or shield you
USE will be the active one.  (Like any other command, the
USE command must be highlighted in white before you can
invoke it.)

To Look In an Object

Some objects in the game can be opened and looked into
(some can just be looked into).  When you click on an ob-
ject, if you can look into it, the LOOK IN Command will be
highlighted.  Click on that command and a description of
what is inside the object (if anything) will appear in the
Lower Window.


Page 12 follows:

To Drop an Object

Click either INV or WEAPONS in the upper left corner of the
screen to bring up the inventory you're cleaning out.  Move
the cursor to the Lower Window, which now displays all the
items in that inventory.

Click & hold on the item you want to drop.  Drag it up to the
Main Window, and release the mouse button.  The item
stays where you drop it until you move it again.  (You think I
don't have better things to do than pick up after you?)

Direction Arrows

The direction arrows located below the inventory commands
let you move through the castle.  The directions currently
available to you are highlighted in red.  To move, simply
click on the arrow that represents the direction you want
to go.

Note that the up/down arrows are highlighted whenever
you are near a stairway and can go up or down.  Clever, isn't
it?  To go up or down, click on the appropriate arrow and be
whisked to another level ... or maybe into the Unknown.
(It's kind of hard to keep track of where all these steps go.)

The Stats Bar

The horizontal bar that runs across the middle of the Main
Window displays your current stats.  At the beginning of the
adventure, you start out at a predetermined (wimpy) level.
Exploring and discovering items increases your experience.

STR - Strength

This is the stat that separates Rambo from The Incredible
Mr. Lipet.  There are only wo things you need to know
about it:

o   Using magic can make you stronger.
o   Getting beat up can make you weaker.

Your strength also affects how much damage you can do to
an opponent in combat.  Also, the higher your strength, the
more items you can carry without beeing adversely affected.


Page 13 follows:

RES - Resilience

This stat determines the amount of damage you can take.

DEX - Dexterity

i run with a fast crowd, and you'd better be able to keep up.
Thi stat measures your agility - and your ability to gain
the advantage at the start of a fight.  See me for a spell that
can make you faster than the proverbial speeding bullet.

SKI - Skill

Your base skill level is displayed when you are not carrying
any weapons.  When you pickup a weapon your skill level
shows how good you are with whatever weapon you've got
in your hand.  Your skill level increases with each successful
battle using a particular weapon.  To find out more about
combat, read the Combat section beginning on page 14.
Skill will vary as you change weapons.

LIF - Life

As in "Life Force."  A high number here means you're defi-
nitely alive.  A lower number means it's getting to be zombie
time.  If it goes to zero, you're dead, the game's over, and
I'm in the markt for a new castle-cleaner.

EXP - Experience

Like I always say, experience counts.  This stat is a percent-
age that reflects how much of the game you've solved.  It
tlls you how far you've come.

Command Menu


Page 14 follows:

Command Menu (continued)

The list on the right side of the Main Screen shows your
action options.  The options are constantly changing,
depending on where you are and what you're doing, but
the currently active options are highlighted in white.

To carry out an action, simply click the word with the left
mouse button.  The options are:

   OPEN              CLOSE            UNLOCK
   LOOK IN           EXAMINE          MIX
   CONSUME           USE              THROW

Other Helpful Commands

There are a few keyboard commands that you may find
helpful:

   M       Press the M key to toggle the music on and off.
Spacebar   Press the spacebar before you enter the castle to
           bypass the opening sequence.

COMBAT

i hate to be th one to tell you this - but there's going to be
blood.  And we're not talking about a few spots of catsup
artistically arranged here and there by a prop manager.  No,
we're talking about industrial-sized buckets of blood.  The
question is: Will it be theirs (yes indeedy, these beasties do
bleed) - or yours?

About the Weapons

Emelda kept quite an arsenal at Killbragant, and it's all
there for you to use ... once you 1) find the weapons, and 2)
learn how to use them.  With a little practice, you'll soon
discover that each weapon has its advantages and disadvan-
tages.  And the more you use a specific weapon, the more
effective you'll become with it.


Page 15 follows:

Practice

OK.  There's good news and bad news.  The good news is
that you can practice your archery skills.  All you have to do
is figure out where.  Archery is a nice skill to have ... because
with a bow you can dispatch the castle's creatures at sev-
eral paces.

The bad news is that archery's the only thing you can prac-
tice.  With all other weapons, it's strictly on-the-job training.

Fighting

During a fight, you're either on offense or defense.  When
you're in offensive mode, the cursor becomes a sword.  In
defense, the cursor becomes a shield.

The comouter automatically switches between the two
modes based on how well you or your nemesis has aimed
his/her/its last thrust and how effective the hit was.  You will
almost always get an attack turn after you successfully fend
off an enemy's attack.

To fight, you can use the Combat Buttons (see page 16).
But you can also wage combat by clicking directly on the
picture of your opponent in the Main Window.  When the
LUNGE/HACK windows appear, click on the left side of the
character to initiate a LUNGE, and on the right side to
HACK the creep.

When the BLOCK/PARRY windows appear, click on the left
side of your opponent to BLOCK a coming blow, and on the
right side to PARRY an insidious advance.

THE COMBAT WINDOW

This window contains combat information.


Page 16 follows:

The Combat Window (continued)

The Combat Window magically appears on the right edge of
the Main Screen whenever you find yourself in a confronta-
tion with an unfriendly entity.  It tells you a few things
about the battle you're in.

Combat Buttons

Click the two large red-and-white rectangles to take action
during a fight.

o   When you're on the offense (and, from what I've seen so
    far, you're probably offensive most of the time), click
    the LUNGE and HACK buttons to slash the intruder
    into submission.

o   When you've lost the upper hand, your defensive op-
    tions are to BLOCK and PARRY.  When you've lost it
    completely, the only option is DEATH.

Numbers

The numbers at the top and bottom of the Combat Informa-
tion area indicate the values, based on hit points, of the
damage being inflicted with each move.

o   The number at the bottom describes the damage you're
    doing unto them.

o   The number at the top is the damage that's being done
    unto you.

The Eyes

In the lower left and right corner of the Main Screen are
"eyes."  Whenever you use magic, in or out of combat, num-
bers appear in this area to let you know how you're doing:

o   Left corner - assesses the damage done to you by
    others' magic.

o   Right corner - shows what your hexes are doing to
    them.


Page 17 follows:

Magic

You can and should use whatever magic you've got before
engaging in combat.  Just choose a spell or potion from your
personal inventory and click the appropriate command on
the Command Menu at the right side of the screen.  For
more information on magic, see the Spellcrafting section
beginning on page 20.

Running Away

It's often true that "He who fights and runs away may live to
fight another day."  Continuing with the cliches, it's also true
that discretion is the better part of valor ... and sometimes
the better part of survival, too.

All the creeps who've occupied Killbragant have staked out
their own little territories (they're practicing dividing up the
world after Emelda's imminent return).  This gives you a
decided advantage.  You can get away from the latest nui-
sance simply by getting off his turf.  In other words, you can
take off, beat it, scram, run away.

Before combat begins, you can run by turning around and
moving away.  But make sure you move far enough away, or
the beast will follow you and beat you up from behind.

Keep this in mind:  If you're hurt, or loaded down with stuff,
you might not get away so easily.  Also note: If you encoun-
ter an Unfriendly and opt to run, the Eye in the lower left
will show the hit points for damage you sustain while being
hit from behind.

Monsters

You'll run into lots of bizarre characters as you explore the
castle and its grounds.  Here's a little guide to the things
that go bump on your head or slash on your throat.

You'll find that some of the monsters look alike, but dress a
little differently.  For example, you might find a soldier with
a blue tunic or a green tunic.  The difference between these


Page 18 follows:

Monsters (continued)

guys isn't just one of taste.  Different colors represent differ-
ent levels of expertise and power.  So the blue soldier is
harder to defeat than the green soldier.  This is consistent
through all levels of creatures.

Some special creatures also appear.  And regardless of the
color they're wearing, they are tough.  Be prepared.  Be
brave.  Be ready to run or bleed.

Below is a list of some of the creatures you'll encounter.
Also listed are some of their stats:

               Skill      Des       Str       Res      Lif

Monks          20-45      50-60     20-40     5-10     60-90
Soldiers       25-50      50-60     30-60     30-50    60-110
Archers        30         55        35        30       65
Knight         50         60        100       50       *
Skeletons      25-50      50-65     35-65     35-55    70-120
Water Beast    40         50        35        40       150
Captain        80         70        80        70       150

* The Knight is invincible in hand-to-hand combat.

SPELLCRAFTING

Just because I made my reputation as "B" movie queen,
people think that my idea of haute cuisine is stale popcorn,
flat cola, ad rock-hard jujubes.  But I'm actually a pretty
decent cook.  Really.  If you don't believe me, just meet me in
the kitchen, and let's see what we can conjure up together.

In fact, you can't get much done at Killbragant without my
culinary expertise.  The kitchen is where  I whip up all the
magical spells you need to get through.  (If uo need any-
thing else whipped up, I'll catch you in the dungeon later,
and we can discuss it.)

Here's how the magic works:

To Create a Spell

The ingredients for each spell can be collected throughout
the castle, and on the grounds outside.  Since I learned to
cook from my Auntie Virus, who was really crummy with
numbers, the amount of stuff you need to make a spell isn't
real specific - though, after some trial and error (and you
should have some of the errors!)  I discovered that it
seems to work out like this:

A cupful is about the same as a handful.

3 handfuls       -      1 saucepan
4 handfuls       -      1 basketfull
6 glasses        -      1 bottle

All the spells, along with their ingredients, are listed in the
spellbook.  Hold the enclosed magic lens (the red acetate
strip) over spells to read them.

1   Bring your ingredients to the kitchen (I'll be waiting),
    click on me and then choose the MIX command from
    the command display.

2   If you habe a copy of the spell book, it will be diplayed in
    the Main Window.  All of the spells will be listed.  Click
    on the Up or Down Arrows to scroll through the list to
    find the spell you want.  Then click on the Spell Name
    in the list.

3   When you have selected the spell you want me to mix,
    all of the magic ingredients you have collected will be
    displayed on the right hand page of the spell book.  Pick
    the objects you want me to use for the spell by clicking
    on them and dragging each one over to the left hand
    page.  When you have selected all of the ingredients for
    the spell, click on the Mix icon on the lower right hand
    page.

If you've given me the right stuff, I can create your vile
concoction right away - and put it into your inventory,
where it appears as a potion bottle or a scroll.

If you goof, and hand me something that's not on the menu,
or find yourself coming up short, so to speak ... well, I'll be
sure to let you know.

To Use a Spell

1   Just select the scroll or bottle from the inventory list.
    The actions you can take with the spell - usually
    CONSUME or USE - are highlighted in the command
    window.

2   Select the action you want, and watch things start to
    happen.

All good things must come to an end sooner or later.  That
includes my spells too.  When you've exhausted the power
of a given spell, it simply disappears from your inventory
list.  Without so much as a decent goodbye.


Now for the Spell Book...

Page 8 follows:

MAIDENS TURNOVER

Required elementes: Maidenhair, Fern, 3 Spyder's webs &
Honey

Take two handfuls of leaves from the Maiden's Tree and
choppe them finely.  Boyle the finely chopped leaves until
totally dissolved into the water to leave a dirty brown liquid.
Blend into this liquid one jar of honey which acts as both a
sweetener and thickening agent.  Shred a handful of fern
sprigs and stir into the mixture which then forms a thick
dough-like paste.  Shape this paste into small packets and
wrap each one in a spyder web.  There is enough of the mix-
ture to make three packets.

causes an increase in skin toughness as tho wearing armor.  It
has no effect on magick and provides no protection against
spelles.

hide & Honey.

Prepare as Maiden's Turnover but wrap each packet in a piece
of Manticore hide.  Causes greater increase in skin toughness.


Page 9 follows:

juice.  Mix juice with the bloode sucked from five live beetles.
Stir the mixture widdershins with the tail feather of a bird
and recite my name backwards.  Store drink in a bottle untill
required.

As the ingredients for this receipt are difficult to obtain at the
same tyme, it is unlikely that more than one portion of this
poyion can be prepared in any one year.  Should you be fortu-
nate enough to obtain the necessary for more than one portion
then a second batch should be stored as though it were fine
wine.

It only takes fifteen minutes to prepare but is most powerful
in its effects.  When consmed it offers total protection to all
non-contact magick weapons and substantial protection from
any other weapone for a considerable tyme.  It should not be
used lightly but saved until needed.


Page 10 follows:

LUCKY SURPRISE

Required elementes: Nettles & one Four Leaf Clover

Boyle a saucepan full of fresh nettles in water for twenty
minutes.  Add a sprig of four leaf clover and continue to boyle
for a further five minutes.  Strain off the liquid, bottle it and
allow to cool whereupon it may be consumed.  This potion
should be used judiciously as excessive consumption will cause
drowsiness and lethargy.

It takes thirty minutes to prepare.  Use of this portion will
make you react quicker unless taken to excess when it will
tend to cause the opposite effect.


PROPITIOUS SURPRISE

Required elementes: Aconite, Nettles & one Four Leaf Clover

This mixture should be prepared as Lucky Surprise but after
straining off the liquid, add three drops of aconite extract to
the decoction and stir for five minutes before bottling.  It
takes forty minutes to prepare.  This potion has the advantage
of not causing drowsiness but otherwise acts as a Lucky Sur-
prise.  The addition of Aconite must be at the tyme of prepara-
tion.  Later addition makes a deadly poison.


Page 11 follows:

MONSTERA PIE

Required elementes: Monstera, Parsley & Ivy

Line a medium sized baking dish with Ivy leaves.  Clean and
separate a 2 cm. basketful of Monstera petals and slice into
thumb joint sized strips.  Place the strips into a baking dish,
add the parsley and cover the contents with another layer of
Ivy leaves.  Place the baking dish in a hot oven and cook for
twenty minutes.  This receipt should provide enough for five
portions and takes thirty minutes to prepare.

Eating a slice of this pie will make the eater stronger but
slightly slow down the eater's reactions.  This slowing is
cummulative for each slice eaten before a previously consumed
slice is fully digested.  Only the foolhardy shude try eating the
whole pie at one sitting because of this side effect.  Used with
due care, consuming a slice of pie will give the eater a useful
boost in strength when it is needed.


Page 12 follows:

GLOWING PRIDE

Required elementes: Thistle, Dandelyon & Flame flower

Remove the petals from one Flamed flower and press them to
remove the oil of which they contain.  Take one Dandelyon and
split its stem.  Allow the milky liquid contained therein to
drip into the previously extracted oil and mix thoroughly.
Pull the down from one Thistle and drop into the oil mixture
so that the down soaks up the mixture.  Roll the down into a
ball.  Thro' practice, tis possible to increase the oil yield from
each flower.

This should take fifteen minutes.  Store the soaked down in
darkness.  As soon as a prepared ball of down is removed from
complete darkness, it will begin to glow.  The length of tyme
that each ball will glow for, is directly proportional to the
user's experience.  If the user is twice as experienced the
second tyme that this magic is used then the light will last for
twice as long.  Useful in those unexpected dark places when
there is no normal light available.


Page 13 follows:

MUSHROOM TENDERNESS

Required elementes: Hellebore, Elderberry & Mushroom

Slice up one bucket of mushrooms and then boyle them untill
reduced to a thick mush.  Crush two handfuls of elderberries
to extract their juice and add the juice to the boyled mush-
rooms.  Choppe up one Hellebore leaf and add to the mixture.
Pour into an appropriate container and drink when required.

Preparation takes 25 minutes and produces enough mixture
for four doses.  Drinking this potion will infuse the user with
superhuman strength for a short period of time.

Boyle four handfuls of nettles for ten minutes and strain off
the liquid, discarding the nettles.  Add thorns from the

spelles.


Page 14 follows:

FINGERLIGHT

Required elementes: Earwigges, Deadly Knightshade and
Belladonna

Extract the juice from a saucepan full of Nightshade berries,
add five earwigges and one chopped belladonna leaf to the
juice and allow to stand for twenty minutes.  Drain the liquid

potion imbues the user with the ability to cast Fingerlight
spelles (lightning boltes).

CAT & DOG BROTH

Required elementes: Spyder, Horse hair, Lily flower and
Witch Hazel

Take a large lily and finely choppe it.  Add the chopped lily to
a basketful of Witch hazel leaves and simmer over a gentle
heate for one hour.  Drain off the resultant liquid into a
saucepan and discard the remains of the flower & leaves.
Remove the skins from ten common spyders and throw them
away.  Crush the spyders to release their bloode and add to the
liquid in the saucepan.  Stir the mixture thoroughly and then
add a tuft of Horse hair.  Raise the liquid to boyling point and
simmer for twenty minutes or until it thickens.  Pour into a
suitable container.  It may be eaten either hot or cold.

This recipe takes an hour and forty minutes to prepare.  When
eaten, this powerful mixture has two effects.  The minor result
of its use, is a boost to strength and general health but the
major effect provides the eater with a large number of
Tunderflash Spelles which can inflict serious damage on the
enemy.


Page 16 follows:

DEMONS BREW

Required elementes: Vampire dust, Dragon's bloode & Deadly
Nightshade

Extract the juice from a saucepan full of Deadly Knightshade
berries and discard the pulp.  Add this juice to one pint of
Dragon's bloode.  Put the Vampire dust in this liquid and
allow it to stand for five minutes.  Drain the mixture through
a muslin cloth to remove all of the sediment and bottle the
resultant liquid.  It is absolutely essential to discard the
sediment on consecrated ground, failing to do so will cause
you moste serious regrets.

This decoction takes twenty five minutes to prepare and
equips anyone who drinks it with a terrible weapon.  For this
reason and because of the ingredients, this is a rare decoction
that you are likely to make only once in a lifetime.  Careless-
ness in making it can also ensure that you only get to make it
once in a lifetime.

Drinking the decoction will provide the drinker with a large
number of Fearful Spelles that do an amazing amount of
damage to any normal creature.


Page 17 follows:

POSTSCRIPTUM


Brain Ache:

When this spelle is cast upon an opponent, it reduces dexterity
by a random amount for the duration of the fight.  It may be
used only once in any single confrontation.

Fearful:

This awesome spelle does terrible damage to any standard
opponent upon whom it is cast.

Fingerlight:

This more potent fight spelle casts a fork of lightning at an
opponent causing damage when it hits.

Fire Dagger:

This spelle appears and acts like a flaming, thrown dagger but
doing three times the damage of a dagger unless the target is
immune to fire.  Used against a mummy, there is a chance of it
catching fire.

Fire Wall:

Lasting for 10 seconds each time it is used, this spelle stops an
opponent attacking and allows the caster to use a ranged
weapone or run away.  It also destroys any ice-based weapon
as well as severely damaging any wooden weapones but these
effects also apply to the caster's weapons.


Page 18 follows:

Ice Wall:

The ice version of Fire Wall, it lasts twice as long but is
almost instantly destroyed by fire-based weapones and only
allows the caster to use ice spelles for its duration.

Identify Plant:

This magickal ability is essential to allow identification of the
many plant ingredients used in the magickal arts.  It is gained
by consuming Herbal Honey.

Knightyme Pleasure:

This is the greatest defensive spelle in that it eliminates all
effects from magickal ranged weapones and halves the effect
of any other weapone.

Lucky Surprise:

This potion increases the imbiber's dexterity by one tenth for
each swig but if more than one swig is taken before an earlier
one wears off this is partially negated by becoming drowsy.

Maiden's Turnover:

This causes a magickal hardening of the eater's skin which
effectively halves sword damage for a tyme.


Page 19 follows:

Manticore Flip:

Similar to Maiden's Turnover but reduces sword damage to
one tenth for a much longer tyme.

Mind Locke:

This spelle is similar to Tangled Mind but of even greater
intensity.

Palmlight:

A more powerful version of Fingerlight that casts ball light-
ning at an opponent for even greater damage.

Propitious Surprise:

Similar effect to Lucky Surprise but without the drowsiness
disadvantage for multiple swigs.

Runic Reading:

This is the ability to read and understand runic writing which
is necessary to understanding and can be obtained by drinking
Alphabet Soup.

Sizzling Egges:

This gives an offensive spelle equivalent to hitting an oppo-
nent somewhat harder than the deadliest concussive weapon.


Page 20 follows:

Tangled Mind:

Similar to Brain Ache but reduces dexterity by a greater
amount.

Thunderflash:

When cast at an opponent this spelle acts as a percussion
weapon which inflicts extensive damage.
