There is evidence of high concentrations of iridium scattered all over
earth's sedimentary rock.  Dated at some 65 million years old, one
interpretation is that the planet was hit by a mass of 13 trillion
tonnes. Such an event would have thrown enough dust into the atmosphere
to block out sunlight for up to five years, killing almost all plant
cover and most of the cold blooded reptiles in existence at this time.

This annihilation is far from unique.  Many smaller scale extinctions
have occurred during the history of life on Earth also coinciding with
impact events.

The Earth's crust is pitted with the remains of impact craters but
slowly worn down by erosion into almost insignificant blemishes.

In 1908, the Tunguz Object exploded before impact, torn apart by Earth's
gravity.  In 1947, the Sikhote-Alin Object made 106 craters, some over
28 miles in diameter.  Although these are recent events and minor ones
at that, they are hardly rarities.  On average the Earth can expect a
major impact event every 170,000 years.  Some people would therefore say
that we have been a little fortunate to have lasted over 700,000 years
without such an impact.  One thing is for certain, with so many
asteroids in orbit between Mars and Jupiter, sooner or later another
major event WILL occur, and at present we neither have the ability nor
the will to produce the ability to avert such a disaster.



                          SEPTEMBER, 2200 A.D.


Every available telescope, orbital and Earth based, turned towards the
constellation of Gemini to follow the incoming Object.  The commanders
on Luna Base 1 and the lo outpost had been ordered to divert all
attention to correlating Earth's observations.  Mathematicians coolly
calculated and sieved through the ocean of information pouring in from
all sources.  Every department, as usual, keeping strict records of the
Object's approach for the history books but everyone involved knew it
would probably be the last chapter.

Its mass, they estimated, was more than 20,000,000,000 tonnes composed
mainly of ice. Velocity and trajectory placed Earth in a direct line in
17.4 hours.  Point of impact was hard to estimate but the worst possible
was expected somewhere in the northern Pacific ocean.

The only practical attempt to change the Object's course had been
futile. A small, fast shuttle had rendezvoused, planted a massive
nuclear charge and run away before detonation.  The required shift was
10 thousand miles if the Object was to miss without causing damage.  The
result was not even measured by any observatories on Earth.

Nothing more could be done.  Every nuclear warhead had been programmed
for specific targets on enemy territory.  Most less than 10,000 miles
away and ALL stationary.  To reprogram so many would take more time
than was available and to expect them to reach a moving target was
ridiculous.  Even if it could have been achieved and all warheads had
struck the Object, the results would have been worse.  One object of 20
trillion tonnes smashed into 1000 pieces would produce a shower of 20
million tonne impacts.  Better, it was decided, to fight a monster than
an army of giants.  Every weapon of destruction upon which man had spent
so much effort suddenly became dwarfed and insignificant.  Earth braced
itself.

As Commander of Luna Base 1, you witnessed the event with an astonished
gaze. All predictions had been correct.  The Object plummeted to Earth
and punched a hole straight through the Pacific throwing millions of
gallons of water vapour into the atmosphere.  Like a bullet through
glass, the Object's velocity was unaffected and smashed into the Earth's
crust cracking it wide open.  With the Object's life now over, the
planet's reaction was devastating.

The underlying magma core, now untethered, ran wild over what used to be
the sea bed and spluttered out thousands of tonnes of molten rock behind
the steam.  As the remaining ocean flooded in to fill the hole it
vaporized instantly with the immense heat.  It seemed an unstoppable
process. Shock waves ran across the planet and Earth rang like a bell.
Vast Earthquakes split even more of the crust adding yet more dust and
steam all over the globe.  Winds raged themselves up to a frenzy
carrying great plumes of debris out into space and across the surface.

Slowly but surely, the blue grey disc turned darker and darker.  Life
ebbed away and civilization ceased to exist.

As far as you were concerned, Luna Base 1 was all that remained of the
Human Race and its culture.  You realised that your base must change from
a minor research station in order to support the survival of mankind.
Terraforming, changing other planets into Earth-like places, was still
in its infancy.  It now seemed that the process would have to be used on
Earth itself.  You also know that the resources of the Moon were not
sufficient to achieve recolonization of Earth.  Other planets would have
to be conquered first to gather enough materials for Terraforming and
the immediate survival of your race.



                              INSTRUCTIONS


CONTROLS
The main game is controlled by using a mouse to move the pointer on
screen, giving you access to the departments of the moonbase, any craft
in service and various data banks at your disposal.  You may also use
a joystick in the second port to give you manual control of craft when
necessary.

The main control icons are at the top of the screen.  Each icon is
identified as you point at it.


MOON BASE
Takes you to a view of the base showing the seven departments.  You amy
also access the base by clicking the right hand mouse button.


COLONIES
Gives you access to any colonies you have established.


CRAFT ROSTER
Gives information of the status and location of any craft you have
built, and enables you to access control of the craft.


DATA BASE
Gives information on the planets and moons of the solar system.


BULLETIN BOARD
Records recent communication of achievements and events.


FILE ACCESS
Enables you to load and save your position.  You may store up to four
different games on a disk.


LOG
Gives your Civilisation and Technology Rating, which is based on the
craft in service, the number of colonies you have established and the
total population.


ZOOM OUT
Allows you to zoom out from any screen to give a view of the entire
solar system.


ADVANCE HOUR


ADVANCE DAY


                              THE MOONBASE


The different departments of the base are accessed by pointing at the
graphic representation of that department and clicking the left hand
mouse button.


RESEARCH
Before you can start to build equipment or collate data on planets or
moons the projects must be researched.  You may instruct the research
department by selecting form seven different categories of projects.


ENERGY
The output of this department may be increased by building and
installing SolaGens.


LIFE SUPPORT
The population of the moonbase can only be increased by building
additional life support nodules.


PRODUCTION
Projects which have been researched may be selected for production by
accessing the small project monitor on the left hand side of the screen.


DEFENCE
You may build both fighters and orbital lasers to defend the moonbase.


RESOURCES
The reserve stock and current output of the mining departments are
displayed on this screen.


FLIGHT BAY
There are eight flight bays which can be accessed by clicking over the
graphic of each bay.



                                THE END
