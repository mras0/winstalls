The most interesting thing about this game is the strange disk format,
which I believe was only ever used on this one title.  Each track contains
a header containing a longword that indicates the number of bytes that are
still left to load.  The game itself doesn't know the length of the data
it's loading, only the disk format itself does!

Special greetings to Gunnar, Xavier and Irek for their patience, Riempie
for originally requesting this install, CFou for interesting chats and the
motivation to finish this patch, and the rest of the original WHDLoad team!
