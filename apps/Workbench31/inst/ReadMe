 This install applies to "Workbench 3.1" © 1993 CBM.

 Requirements:
 -------------
 This install requires WHDLoad to be in the path.

 The installed program requires 1..2 MB ChipMem and 2..33 MB OtherMem.
 It can be quit by pressing F10 (key can be changed with Tooltype "QuitKey=").

 The game requires an installed A600/A1200/A4000 Kickstart 3.1 image.
 The kickstart image must be located in the directory "Devs:Kickstarts" and
 must be named "kick40063.A600", "kick40068.A1200" or "kick40068.A4000". The
 image can be extracted from a A600/A1200/A4000 with tools like 'GrabKick' or
 similar which can be found on aminet.
 If the image is of wrong version or altered in any way WHDLoad will quit with
 an appropriate message.
 Additionally the file "kick40063.A600.RTB", "kick40068.A1200.RTB" or
 "kick40068.A4000.RTB" must be installed in the same directory as the kickstart
 image. It can be found in the archive "util/boot/skick346.lha" on aminet.

 Features:
 ---------
 This installs the Workbench under WHDLoad. You may add other software manually
 by copying it to the installation directory.
 It is tested with original 6 disk DD Floppy release. It should also work with
 the 3 disk HD floppy release, but this is untested.
 To speedup the preload process you may delete all unwanted files, e.g. other
 languages, fonts etc.

 provided and installed are 3 slaves with different memory requirements:
  Workbench31_1.Slave   1 MB Chip  1 MB Fast
  Workbench31_4.Slave   2 MB Chip  4 MB Fast
